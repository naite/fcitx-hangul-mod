Description: Free Chinese Input Toy of X - hangul module
 Fcitx is the Free Chinese Input Toy of X, which was initially designed
 for Chinese users, and used XIM protocol. Now it has already evolved
 into a highly modularized, feature rich input method framework for
 Unix-like platforms supporting a considerable amount of frontends,
 backends and modules.
 .
 It is an ideal choice for the vast majority. Many of its features make
 users of Unix-like platforms have a fully modern input experience for
 the first time. It has also greatly lower the threshold for developers,
 making the development of extended funtions much easier than ever before.
 .
 This package provides the hangul module, which uses libhangul, 
 the Hangul keyboard input library.
